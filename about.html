      <h2>Ever since I was little...</h2>

      <p>
        I have been obsessed with computers and programming. My 10-year birthday gift was a new laptop. Initially, I only played online flash games
        and spent most of my time browsing the internet. Video games <em>inspired</em> me. I adored many games from simple flash games like <i>Age of War</i> to open-world,
        creative ones like <i>Minecraft</i>. Eventually, I grew frustrated with their limits. I wanted to conform video games and play them exactly how I wanted to. I wanted new items,
        new characters, new features -- but I knew all my wishes were in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's when I learnt about programming languages: the very tool that was used to make all these games. Despite my young age, I was fascinated by their power.
        Python was the beginning of my journey, a simple and beginner-friendly language. I began with text adventure projects, simple text-based games with no graphics. I made
        other kinds of projects as well, the kind you would learn in school, except I was teaching myself through the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I grew older, I delved into more advanced languages like C++ and Java. The immense strength and capabilities of C++ astonished me, and it is still one of my favourite
        programming languages. Java, being the language used to make Minecraft, was also amazing to me. I studied a vast range of topics like website building, databases, machine learning, and more.
        The bounds of computer science seemed endless.

      <h2>What now?</h2>

      <p>
        I am still a young adult, but I have come a long way. As of right now, I am pursuing a B.S. in Software Development at Bellevue University. This journey
        is a long and fruitful one with many finished projects to show for.
        Even with a part-time job to support me, I am still driven toward something bigger: personal independence and success. Right now, I am working hard to achieve that vision,
        expanding my knowledge of computer science.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website is just a single one of my creations I am proud of.
